NLP에는 다양한 task들이 존재한다. 문서 요약은 이러한 task들 중의 하나로 주어진 문서의 내용을 모델이 파악하여 요약을 생성한다. 문서 요약에는 Extractive Summarization과 Abstractive Summarization라는 2가지 유형이 존재하는데 이번 글에서는 Abstractive Summarization를 다루는 논문을 소개하겠다. 



You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('Tom')
```
